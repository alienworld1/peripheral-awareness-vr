- **Improved initialization**: Step-by-step initialization with status reporting
- **Debug methods**: Added GetVoiceRecognitionStatus() and RestartVoiceRecognitionSystem()

### 2. VoiceBridge.java Improvements  
- **Thread safety**: Ensures speech recognition runs on UI thread
- **Permission checking**: Verifies microphone permissions before initialization
- **Enhanced logging**: Detailed logging for debugging
- **Better error handling**: More specific error messages

### 3. AndroidManifest.xml Updates
- **Additional permissions**: Added network state and audio modification permissions
- **Speech recognition queries**: Added queries section for Android 11+ compatibility
- **Activity configuration**: Improved activity settings for better performance

### 4. SimpleVRGoggleDisplay.cs Enhancements
- **Debug shortcuts**: Added keyboard shortcuts (V, R, T keys) for testing
- **Status display**: Methods to show voice recognition status
- **Manual restart**: Ability to restart voice recognition system

## Testing Steps

### 1. Build and Deploy
```bash
# Use the provided script
deploy_and_test.bat
```

### 2. First Run Checklist
1. **Permission Dialog**: App should request microphone permission on first run
2. **Voice Status**: Press 'V' key to see voice recognition status
3. **Manual Restart**: Press 'R' key if voice recognition isn't working
4. **Test Recognition**: Press 'T' key to test with current displayed letter

### 3. Debug Information
Monitor logcat for voice recognition status:
```bash
adb logcat -s VoiceBridge:* Unity:* *VoiceInput*:*
```

## Expected Log Messages

### Successful Initialization
```
🎤 Microphone permission already granted
🔧 Starting Android speech recognition initialization...
✅ Unity activity obtained successfully
🎙️ Speech recognition availability check: true
🎙️ Speech recognition is available, creating VoiceBridge...
✅ Voice recognition initialized successfully with VoiceBridge
🔤 Letters are now displayed, starting voice recognition...
🎤 Starting voice recognition for letter detection...
🎯 StartListening called - isListening: false, isInitialized: true...
🎤 Attempting to start voice recognition...
✅ Voice recognition start command sent successfully
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Permission Not Granted
**Symptoms**: App shows "🔒 Microphone permission required"
**Solution**: 
- Manually grant permission in Android Settings > Apps > VR Letter Trainer > Permissions
- Or uninstall and reinstall the app to trigger permission dialog again

#### 2. Speech Recognition Not Available
**Symptoms**: App shows "🔇 Speech recognition not available on device"
**Solution**:
- Ensure Google app is installed and updated
- Check if voice services are available in device settings
- Try on a different Android device

#### 3. Voice Input Not Starting
**Symptoms**: No voice recognition activity, no listening status
**Solution**:
- Press 'V' key to check status
- Press 'R' key to restart voice recognition
- Check logcat for specific error messages

#### 4. No Response to Voice Commands
**Symptoms**: Voice recognition appears active but doesn't respond
**Solution**:
- Speak clearly and close to device microphone
- Try saying the letter phonetically (e.g., "Ay" for "A", "Bee" for "B")
- Check ambient noise levels
- Verify microphone is working in other apps

## Manual Testing Commands

### Voice Status Check
Press 'V' key or use this debug command:
```csharp
// In Unity console or debug script
voiceInput.GetVoiceRecognitionStatus()
```

### Force Restart
Press 'R' key or use this debug command:
```csharp
// In Unity console or debug script  
voiceInput.RestartVoiceRecognitionSystem()
```

### Simulate Voice Input
Press 'T' key or use this debug command:
```csharp
// In Unity console or debug script
voiceInput.SimulateVoiceInput("A") // Replace "A" with target letter
```

## File Locations
- Main voice script: `Assets/AndroidVoiceInput.cs`
- VR display script: `Assets/SimpleVRGoggleDisplay.cs`
- Android plugin: `Assets/Plugins/Android/VoiceBridge.java`
- Android manifest: `Assets/Plugins/Android/AndroidManifest.xml`
- Build script: `deploy_and_test.bat`

## Performance Tips
1. **Test in quiet environment** for better voice recognition accuracy
2. **Speak clearly** and at normal volume
3. **Use phonetic pronunciations** if direct letter names don't work
4. **Monitor device performance** - voice recognition uses CPU and battery

## Contact Information
If issues persist, check Unity console logs and Android logcat output for specific error messages. The enhanced logging should provide detailed information about where the voice recognition process is failing.
